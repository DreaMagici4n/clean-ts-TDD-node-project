  This API is a hands-on endeavor aimed at building a robust Authentication API for personal learning and skill development. Embracing Clean Architecture, SOLID principles, Test-Driven Development (TDD), TypeScript, Node.js, and MongoDB, this project offers an opportunity to delve into advanced software engineering concepts while creating a secure authentication system. Hope you find it useful!

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [usage](#usage) for notes on how to start the API.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

You'll need to have docker in your machine:
```
apt-get install docker
```
